In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

    Compile-time Polymorphism- static polymorphism achieved by function overloading or operator overloading.
    Runtime Polymorphism


note : But Java doesnâ€™t support the Operator Overloading.

When an object of child class is created, then the method inside the child class is called. This is because
 The method in the parent class is overridden by the child class. Since The method is overridden,
 This method has more priority than the parent method inside the child class. So, the body inside the
  child class is executed.
