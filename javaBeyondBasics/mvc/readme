The MVCMain class fetches the employee data from the method where we have entered the values.
Then it pushes those values in the model. After that, it initializes the view (EmployeeView.java).
When view is initialized, the Controller (EmployeeController.java) is invoked and bind it to Employee class
 and EmployeeView class.
 At last the updateView() method (method of controller) update the employee details to be printed to the console.
