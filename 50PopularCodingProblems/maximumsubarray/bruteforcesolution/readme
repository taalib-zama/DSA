1 .calculate sum of each subarray, keeping track of max one.

ex : arr = [4,-7,1,5].
    lets see different subarays, for that we use two pointers that represent the boundaries of actual subarray,
    a) i and j are both equal to 0 , we have subarray that contains only element 4.
    b) then we increment j, we get subarray that goes from index 0-1
    c)) we increment j again, we get the subarray from index 0-2 i.e. [4,-7,1].
    d) increment j again, subarray : [4,-7,1,5].

    e) next we move i to start reading subarrays from index 1,

    for each subarray we will use  another for loop to calculate the sum of that subarray,
    then we compare it with the maximum sum we found until now to see if its replaced.
