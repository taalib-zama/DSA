ex : [3,5,7,8,9]
k = 10

1. taking the first and last element.
    3, 9  = 12. since 12 >10 we can either decrement the left selection or right end selection.
2. to choose this, we use a sorted array, now if we increment the left index we get,
                 5 + 9 = 14   which is useless as pair sum will either increase or remain same due to sroted array.

3. so moving the right index left will decrease our sum.
4. we use 2 point technique, one index starts with first index and other at last
    while left > right
        if(arr[left] + arr[right] == k
            return true.
        else if arr[left] + arr[right] < k   --> we have to make it bigger so we increment left pointer.
                    left +=1
        else  --> it means our sum is bigger so we decrement right pointer to decrease the sum.
                    right -=1
    return false.
