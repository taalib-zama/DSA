Given an array of integers arr that contains n+1 elements between 1 and n inclusive. Create a function
that returns  the duplicate element ( element that appears more than once).

Assumption : There is only one duplicate number.
            The duplicate number can be repeated more than once. (pigeonhole principle)


Ex : [4,2,1,3,1]
    return 1.
