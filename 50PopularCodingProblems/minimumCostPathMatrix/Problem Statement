     use of Dynamic programming :
     Dynamic Programming (DP) is an algorithmic technique for solving an optimization problem by breaking
     it down into simpler subproblems and utilizing the fact that the optimal solution
     to the overall problem depends upon the optimal solution to its subproblems.
