Example 1: 1. Two Sum

Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of two numbers such that they add up to target.
You cannot use the same index twice.


The brute force solution would be to use a nested for loop to iterate over every pair of indices and check if the sum
is equal to target. This will result in a time complexity of O(n2)
