Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using
all the original letters exactly once.

Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]


two strings are anagrams of each other if the sorted version of them is same.


Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]


Solution 1 : one way to group anangrams togerther would be take eaqch one of these string in input and sort them
but time complecity id going to be nlogn and we have to do this m times .


Solution 2 : since each character id going to be between [a-z], atmmost we'll have 6 unique characters. So for each of these strings
the charc from a-z

ex : eat = 1e, 1a, 1t

using a hashmap with key as [1e,1a,1t] and value as string . so whatever string have pattern of count 1e1a1t, we'll
add the string as value to its key grouping them together

Time complexity fo this will be O(m) - where m is total no of string we have in string
