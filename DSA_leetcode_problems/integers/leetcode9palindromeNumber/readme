Q .
Given an integer x, return true if x is palindrome integer.

An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

For example, 121 is a palindrome while 123 is not.


Solution :
    1. REVERSE THE INTERGER
    2. CHECK IF SAME OR NOT
    3. REVERSING AN INTERGER MIGHT RESULT IN OVERFLOW.
    4. SO WE JUST REVERSE THE FIRST/LAST HALF OF INTEGER.
        If length of given interger is even then we split integer at middle
        then we reverse the 2nd half.

        If integer is of oddlength ex : 121. then we split the integer at 1,21 and reverse 21 as 12, remove last digit \
        of reversed part, then we compare the leftover with other half.
