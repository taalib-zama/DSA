In doubly LL we have nodes, a head,  a tail and each node in the list points to the next and the previous.

So this time we'll have 2 reference fields i.e next field and the previous field.
for the first item in the list the previous fields will point to null. And the last item in the list the
next field will point to null.

We can traverse the list front to back and vice versa.
