Quicksort is another Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks one element of an array as the pivot and sorts all of the
 other elements around it, for example smaller elements to the left, and larger to the right.
The input list is divided into two sub-lists by an element called pivot; one sub-list with elements less than the pivot and another one with elements greater than the pivot. This process repeats for each sub-list.

Finally, all sorted sub-lists merge to form the final output

 time complexity = O(nlogn)

ex :
Arr[] = {5, 9, 4, 6, 5, 3}
Let's suppose we pick 5 as the pivot for simplicity
We'll first put all elements less than 5 in the first position of the array: {3, 4, 5, 6, 5, 9}
We'll then repeat it for the left sub-array {3,4}, taking 3 as the pivot
There are no elements less than 3
We apply quicksort on the sub-array in the right of the pivot, i.e. {4}
This sub-array consists of only one sorted element
We continue with the right part of the original array, {6, 5, 9} until we get the final ordered array
