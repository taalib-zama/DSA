151. Reverse Words in a String

Q. Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
  Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words.
 The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.


 Example 1:

 Input: s = "the sky is blue"
 Output: "blue is sky the"


 Example 2:

 Input: s = "  hello world  "
 Output: "world hello"
 Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.


 Example 3:

 Input: s = "a good   example"
 Output: "example good a"
