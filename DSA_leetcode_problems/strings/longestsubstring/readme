Q. given a string str made of alphabets only. Create a function that returns the length of the longest substring
    without repeating characters.


    steps : 1. find-longest substring length (maxLength).
            2. substring - part of string where characters are contigious.
            3. without repeating chars - each char must appear once.


2 pointer technique/
ex : abcdbeghef.
Substrings :
  1. abcd
  2. cdbegh
  3. ghef

Steps : building the first substring, add the first character, no duplicate character, so we add the socond and so on,
    Now if we try to add the fifth character, here we will have problem because we have already added letter 'b'
    in our substring. So we can remove characters from left, so we keep removing until the first occourence of
    repeated character.In above we remove the above 2 characters.
    Now we continue with our 2nd substring i.e "cdbegh". but for the letter 'e',we already have an e in our substring.
    So we remove all the parts till first occourence of 'e'. Now we take the max length of abce 2.
