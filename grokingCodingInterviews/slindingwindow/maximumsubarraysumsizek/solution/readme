------approach 2 :
to calculate the sum of a contiguous subarray we can utilize the sum of the previous subarray.\

For this, consider each subarray as a Sliding Window of size ‘k’. To calculate
the sum of the next subarray, we need to slide the window ahead by one element


So to slide the window
forward and calculate the sum of the new position of the sliding window, we need to do two things:
1. Subtract the element going out of the sliding window i.e., subtract the first element of the window.
2. Add the new element getting included in the sliding window i.e., the element coming right after the
    end of the windwow.

This approach will save us from re-calculating the sum of the overlapping part of the sliding window.
