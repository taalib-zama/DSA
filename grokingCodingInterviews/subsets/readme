leetcode subset 1 :
A huge number of coding interview problems involve dealing with Permutations and Combinations of a given
set of elements. This pattern describes an efficient Breadth First Search (BFS) approach to handle all these
problems


78.Subsets : Given an integer array nums of unique elements, return all possible
             subsets
              (the power set).

             The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

             Example 1:

             Input: nums = [1,2,3]
             Output: [[],[1],[2],[1,2],[3],[1,3],[2,3],[1,2,3]]


             Example 2:

             Input: nums = [0]
             Output: [[],[0]]



oGiven set: [1, 5, 3]
1. Start with an empty set: [[]]
2. Add the first number (1) to all the existing subsets to create new subsets: [[], [1]];
3. Add the second number (5) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5]];
4. Add the third number (3) to all the existing subsets: [[], [1], [5], [1,5], [3], [1,3], [5,3], [1,5,3]].
