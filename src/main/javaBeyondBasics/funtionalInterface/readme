A functional interface(SAM interface = single abstract method interface) is an interface that contains only one
abstract method. They can have only one functionality to exhibit.

 lambda expressions can be used to represent the instance of a functional interface. A functional interface can have any
  number of default methods. Runnable, ActionListener, Comparable are some of the examples of functional interfaces.
=====================================================================================================================
Functional interfaces are used and executed by representing the interface with an annotation called @FunctionalInterface.
As described earlier, functional interfaces can contain only one abstract method. However, they can include any quantity
 of default and static methods.

================================================================================================================
In Functional interfaces, there is no need to use the abstract keyword as it is optional to use the abstract keyword
 because, by default, the method defined inside the interface is abstract only. We can also call Lambda expressions as
 the instance of functional interface.
