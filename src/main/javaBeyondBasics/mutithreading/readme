When we talk about multithreading, we donâ€™t care if the machine has a 2-core processor or a 16-core processor.
Our work is to create a multithreaded application and let the OS handle the allocation and execution part.
In short, multithreading has nothing to do with multiprocessing.


Java supports multithreading through Thread class.
Java Thread allows us to create a lightweight process that executes some tasks.
We can create multiple threads in our program and start them.
Java runtime will take care of creating machine-level instructions and work with OS to execute them in parallel.
