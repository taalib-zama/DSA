Q. Given an array of integer 'arr' and integer 'k'. Create a boolean function that checks if  there exists two
elements in array such that we get k upon adding them.

Ex 1 :
        arr = [4,5,1,7,2]
        k = 3.
        Sum  = 1 + 2.

Ex 2 :
        arr = [3,5,7,8,9]
        k = 10
        sum = 3 + 9.
