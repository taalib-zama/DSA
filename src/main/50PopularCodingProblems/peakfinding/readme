Q. Given a non empty array of integers arr. Create a function that returns the index of peak element. We
    consider an element as peak if its greater than or equal to its neighbours, the next and its previous element.
  -The first and last element element have atmost 1 neighbour only.
  -If there are multiple peaks in arr, just return the index of one of them.

  ex : [1,5,8,8,3,9]
        returned index  = 3.

  1. either the element is first element or its greater than or equal previous element and either its the
    last element ot its greater than or equal to  next element

    Solution breakdown :
    1. for first element 1 , here it has only one neighbour. Comparing with its neighbour its less than 5, so
    its not a peak.

    2. 2nd element 5 is greater than its left neighbour but smaller than its right neighbour. So its not a peak.
    3. 3rd element 8 is greater than previous element and equal to next element, so it can be a peak.
