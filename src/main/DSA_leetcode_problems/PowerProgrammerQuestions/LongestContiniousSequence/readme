given an aray of 0's and 1's, write a functiona to return the position of 0 followed by the longest continious
seqence of 1's.

sample StringDuplicates case :
arr = {0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1}
o/p : 5 ( index of 6th 0).

arr = {1,1,1,0,1}
o/p - 3  (the first 0 so we consider the loingest subsequence after that
