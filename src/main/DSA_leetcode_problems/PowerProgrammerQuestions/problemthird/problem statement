It is given that for two integers x and y, thew cost function C(x,y) id defined as follows :
    if  x> y :
        c(X,Y) = C(x,y) =-x;
    otherwise :
        C(x,y) = C(x/y,y) +x MOD y;
you have been given two integers x and c, such that C(x,y)=c, for some y.

Find the smallest value of y, which satisfies the above defined cost function, if no such y exists return -1;

note : it is given that 2<=y<=2000000000.

sample :
1. i/p : 3,2
    o/p : 2

2. i/p : 4,4
    o/p
