The time complexity of stack operations is dependent on the implementation. If you use a dynamic array, which is the most common and easiest way, then the time complexity of your operations is the same as that of a dynamic array.

O(n) search. Sometimes, a stack may be implemented with a linked list with a tail pointer

For algorithm problems, a stack is a good option whenever you can recognize the LIFO pattern.
Usually, there will be some component of the problem that involves elements in the input interacting with
each other. Interacting could mean matching elements together, querying some property such as "how far is
the next largest element", evaluating a mathematical equation given as a string, just comparing elements against
each other, or any other abstract interaction. Sometimes, the LIFO property is hard to see, but we'll make sure
to talk about how we recognize it in this chapter
