prefix sum - sum of all prefixes.


this method allows us to find the sum of any subarray in O(1).

for sum of a subarray betwen i and j :
sum = prefix[i] - prefix[i-1] or
prefix[j] - prefix[i] + nums[i].

Given an array nums,

prefix = [nums[0]]
for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++)
    prefix.append(nums[i] + prefix[prefix.length - 1])



    It only costs
    �
    (
    �
    )
    O(n) to build but allows all future subarray queries to be
    �
    (
    1
    )
    O(1), so it can usually improve an algorithm's time complexity by a factor of
    �
    (
    �
    )
    O(n),



Building a prefix sum is a form of pre-processing. Pre-processing is a useful strategy in a variety of problems where we store pre-computed data in a data structure before running the main logic of our algorithm.
