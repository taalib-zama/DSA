OOPs refers to languages that use objects in programming, they use objects as a primary source to
implement what is to happen in the code. Objects are seen by the viewer or user, performing tasks
assigned by you. Object-oriented programming aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance,
hiding, polymorphism etc. in programming. The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the
functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created. It represents the set
of properties or methods that are common to all objects of one type. Using classes, you can create
multiple objects with the same behavior instead of writing their code multiple times.
class consists of : Modifiers, Class name, Superclass, Interfaces, Body

An object is a basic unit of Object-Oriented Programming that represents real-life entities.
A typical Java program creates many objects, which as you know, interact by invoking methods.
The objects are what perform your code, they are the part of your code visible to the viewer/user.

state (Attributes), Behavior(methods), Identity (nique name given to an object that enables it to interact with other objects.)
